**Unit 2: Women and the Church** <span id="2"></span> 
*In the Middle Ages, the Church—an institution that then enjoyed
cohesive social, political, and cultural power—monopolized education;
besides a few wealthy aristocrats, clergymen and clergywomen were the
only members of society that learned to read and write.  For this
reason, a good number of female-authored works from the Middle Ages are
by nuns, mystics, and other religiously-minded women.  In this unit, we
will perform close readings of a number of works by such individuals,
examining their self-presentation, their figurations of Christ and
religious experiences, and the ways in which a predominantly masculine
theology may have shaped or limited their self-expression. *

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Identify and explain the major ideas associated with Medieval women
    and the Church.
-   Discuss, in general terms, Medieval theology, the Church’s control
    of the press, emerging religious communities, as well as Medieval
    persecution, nunnery, conceptions of love, scripture and theology,
    hagiography, martyrdom, and sainthood.
