Scholarship on medieval women writers is a somewhat recent phenomenon,
in part because we know relatively little about men of the Middle
Ages—and what we know about women from the period is even more limited. 
In this course, we will engage this new frontier in literary studies by
examining the writings of a diverse group of medieval women—from
reclusive anchoresses to aristocratic women of the court—and analyzing
the perceptions of reality, both secular and religious, that they
present.  We will also read and respond to a number of critical essays
concerning medieval women and the various debates that have emerged in
the study of their works. We will begin the course with a unit on
context, acquainting ourselves with the major socio-historical
developments that shaped the period as well as the little that is known
about medieval women and their roles in society.  We will then take a
look at some major feminist and gender/sex-related approaches to
literature, making their various methods and beliefs available to us as
we progress through the course. The remainder of the course has been
divided into two major units: women of the Church, and women of the
secular world.  In each of these units, we will perform close readings
of women-authored texts, examining their styles, techniques, and
representations of the world around them.
