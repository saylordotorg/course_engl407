**Unit 3: Secular Female Authors in the Medieval World** <span
id="3"></span> 
*Outside of the Church, education was limited to the very wealthy.  In
this unit, we will read a number of works by aristocratic women,
examining their conceptualizations of their lives and their roles in
society.  Not surprisingly, these women tend to decry the misogynistic
and male-centric world in which they live; many consider these authors
proto-feminists.  We will conclude with a section entitled “Men Writing
Women,” where we will compare and contrast the ways in which men and
women “wrote” the female figure.*

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Describe the nature and function of Medieval secular female
    authorship.
-   Describe Medieval class structure, aristocratic women, and
    working-class women.
-   Discuss the formal and structural conventions of the Medieval lay
    and Medieval textual representations of love, desire, romance,
    marriage, widowhood, masculinity, femininity, and literary
    self-expression.
-   Describe the ways in which Medieval men wrote from the perspective
    of women.
-   Explain Chaucer’s treatment of women in his *Canterbury Tales*.
